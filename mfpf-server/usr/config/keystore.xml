    IBM Worklight requires SSL and declared the "defaultKeyStore" default keystore. 
        [Added by IBM Worklight <installWorklightAdmin> Ant task for context root '/wladmin'] 
    This configuration is the minimum one that you need to create an SSL configuration.
    With this configuration, the Liberty server creates the keystore and the certificate, 
    if it does not exist yet, during the SSL initialization.
    The created certificate is a self-signed certificate that is valid for 365 days.
    Do not use the certificates that the Liberty server created for production use.
